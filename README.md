@@ Features

* Basic Mode: Input posttax bill amount and tax amount, choose how many people are sharing and the how much tip you'd like to offer and the app just gives you the grand total and the amount that each one should pay.
* Party Mode: Party mode is designed to make sure that everyone is paying what they really need to pay. When you got your bill, first enter the amount of tax listed on your bill. Then just scan through the bill from top to bottom and input the name of each entry in the app; if the entry is for everyone, use `+ Shared Entry`, otherwise `+ Personal Entry`. When you're done, click on the top right calculate icon and you can see how much each one should pay. Furthermore, clicking on the person will show you the breakdown of how the amount was calculated.
